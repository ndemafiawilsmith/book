Her mother grew up attending private schools and afternoon teas, but she married the local handyman. After her mother died when Joce was only five years old, her father remarried into his own class, and Joce became an outsider -- until she met Edilean Harcourt. Although she was sixty years Joce's senior, Miss Edi was a kindred soul who understood her like no one else ever had. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Miss Edi passes away, she leaves Joce all her worldly possessions, including an eighteenth-century house and a letter with clues to a mystery that began in 1941. In the letter, Miss Edi also mentions that she has found the perfect man for Joce -- a handsome young lawyer. Joce is shocked to learn that the mystery, the house, and the future love of her life are all in Edilean, a small town in Virginia that Miss Edi never told her about. Hurt that the woman who meant so much to her kept so many secrets, Jocelyn moves to this tight-knit village in an attempt to understand the legacy that has been left to her. As she begins to dig into Miss Edi's mystery, she soon discovers some shocking surprises about her family's history and her own future -- and she meets a man with his own mysterious past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;From Publishers Weekly&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Family ties, smalltown values and unexpected love in picturesque settings have made Deveraux a longtime bestselling author, so it's no surprise she again delivers on her tried-and-true formula. Jocelyn Joce Minton, daughter of a Williamsburg, Va., debutante and a handyman, is alienated from her family after her widowed father marries a woman who is decidedly not debutante material and has a pair of selfish twins. Joce ends up in the care of an elderly neighbor, Miss Edi, who watches over the girl through college. When Miss Edi dies, she leaves Joce an ancestral manor house and a trove of secrets going back to 1941 that compel Joce to visit Edilean, Va., where she meets the local color, including a sexy lawyer and his sexier gardener cousin—who has a secret or two, himself. Alternating WWII battlefront tragedy with contemporary romance, Deveraux packs in something for every generation, from wicked supermodels to patriotic sacrifice, from planting an herb garden to DNA tests. For all the novel's coincidences and predictability, readers will find it hard to resist the charm of Edilean, the manor house, the town, the woman of many secrets and, of course, the series to follow. &lt;em&gt;(Apr.)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;From Booklist&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jocelyn Minton is a young woman of many contradictions. Her wealthy mother married the local handyman. After her mother dies, her father returns to his blue-collar roots and marries a woman who has two gorgeous twin daughters who torment Joce. The only bright spot in her life is Edilean Harcourt, an older woman who connected with Joce on every level and enriched her life until she died. Joce thought she knew her mentor and protector very well, until Edilean leaves Joce her family home in Edilean, Virginia, and Joce discovers how heavily edited her version of Edilean’s life is. As she follows Edilean’s instructions and moves into the house and contacts a young lawyer, Joce enters a new world, learns the truth about her dear friend, and meets the insular inhabitants of the town, including her own bad boy—not the lawyer, but his cousin Luke, her gardener. With the promise of future books about surprising and interesting Edilean, veteran storyteller Deveraux incorporates her trademark sweet and salty characters into a pair of entertaining romances, one past, one present, to create one of her most fun and pleasing tales. --Patty Engelmann &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</dc:description></dp:metadata><dp:privateData xmlns:dp="http://ns.adobe.com/digitalpublishing"><totalPageCount xmlns="http://ns.adobe.com/digitaleditions">265</totalPageCount></dp:privateData><dp:tags xmlns:dp="http://ns.adobe.com/digitalpublishing"><dp:tag>private:ub42</dp:tag></dp:tags></contentRecord>
