Fascinated with history, and desperately trying to finish her dissertation, she's hoping against all hope that the papers will yield new information to invigorate her research.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What she didn't expect to find is references to the Heartwishes Stone - believed by most to be pure legend - and said to grant wishes to anyone named Frazier.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Gemma learns more about the family -- and even begins falling in love with the eldest son, Colin -- it becomes increasingly clear that their wishes are actually coming true.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, Gemma and Colin must work together to find the stone that's been missing for over one hundred years -- and with an international thief also on the hunt, the clock is ticking. Because in the wrong hands, no one named Frazier will ever be safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</dc:description></dp:metadata><dp:privateData xmlns:dp="http://ns.adobe.com/digitalpublishing"><totalPageCount xmlns="http://ns.adobe.com/digitaleditions">287</totalPageCount></dp:privateData><dp:tags xmlns:dp="http://ns.adobe.com/digitalpublishing"><dp:tag>private:ub42</dp:tag></dp:tags></contentRecord>
