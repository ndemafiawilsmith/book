Like all politicians, Grafstein became obsessed with the factors that made a leader a leader. Is leadership a natural or a learned skill set? What unique amalgam of oratory skill, ambition, character, persistence, detachment, decisiveness, empathy, intelligence, personality, experiences, memory, common sense, ideas, judgement, temperament and, most especially, self-awareness, separate wannabe leaders from the pinnacle of leadership? This is a unique book written by an acute legal mind, a powerful political strategist, a very successful media and communication expert, an engaged Canadian, and a most thoughtful Liberal. Senator Grafstein assesses, evaluates, and appreciates these Canadian Prime Ministers with insight, humor, and generosity.</dc:description></dp:metadata><dp:privateData xmlns:dp="http://ns.adobe.com/digitalpublishing"><totalPageCount xmlns="http://ns.adobe.com/digitaleditions">305</totalPageCount></dp:privateData><dp:tags xmlns:dp="http://ns.adobe.com/digitalpublishing"><dp:tag>private:ub43</dp:tag></dp:tags></contentRecord>
