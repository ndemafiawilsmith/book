After her divorce and her father's death in early 1991, 28-year-old Sam Elliott arrives in New York City to search for clues to the riddle of her grandmother's mysterious 1964 disappearance. Her father's will directs her to spend a year on this quest while renting an apartment from his young friend Mike Taggert, who is writing a book about Prohibition-era gangster Doc Barrett. Mike needs Sam's assistance to land an interview with the still-living Barrett, and despite her fear of her dangerously attractive landlord she becomes increasingly involved with his work and attracted to both him and his large, loving family; she also comes closer to the truth about her grandmother's bizarre past. Deveraux knows Manhattan and provides entertaining descriptions of the speakeasy age in Harlem, but her cliche-laden dialogue makes it seem that her characters speak English as a second language. The highly improbable story line, overloaded with convoluted plots and subplots, will discourage even the most die-hard romance fan.

Orphaned at 28 by her father's death, Samantha Elliott has &lt;code&gt;seen more death than most people experience in a lifetime.'' First, she lost her grandparents; now both parents are dead. Fresh from New Mexico, Samantha is in New York to honor her father's will, which requires her to live there for a year while searching for the grandmother who disappeared when she was a toddler. But Samantha is soon paralyzed by depression and a morbid fear of the city; fortunately, though, Superman is close at hand in the muscle- bound person of Samantha's landlord, tall-dark-'n'-handsome Mike Taggert--who gives her the most passionate kiss of her life when they first meet and before they've exchanged even a word. Together, Samantha and Mike will reconstruct her grandmother's fate (much of which is strikingly similar to the 1985 movie Maxie). In the process, Samantha has an emotional reunion with her only surviving relative, gradually gets back in touch with her feelings, and discovers in herself a passion for shopping so pure that she sings paeans even to the&lt;/code&gt;very pretty lavatory'' in a Ralph Lauren shop. And, yes, she falls hard for Mike, who gets her pregnant and then marries her, a true hero for the '90s. Super-dumb and super-tedious.
