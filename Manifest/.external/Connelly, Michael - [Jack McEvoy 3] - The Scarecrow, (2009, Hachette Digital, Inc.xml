But as he delves into the story, Jack realizes that Winslow's so-called confession is bogus. The kid might actually be innocent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jack is soon running with his biggest story since The Poet made his career years ago. He is tracking a killer who operates completely below police radar--and with perfect knowledge of any move against him. Including Jack's. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Michael Connelly and Janet Evanovich: Author One-to-One&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this Amazon exclusive, we brought together blockbuster authors Michael Connelly and Janet Evanovich and asked them to interview each other. Find out what two of the top authors of their genres have to say about their characters, writing process, and more. Janet Evanovich is the bestselling author of the Stephanie Plum novels, including &lt;em&gt;Finger Lickin' Fifteen&lt;/em&gt;, twelve romance novels, the Alexandra Barnaby novels, and &lt;em&gt;How I Write: Secrets of a Bestselling Author&lt;/em&gt;. Read on to see Janet Evanovich's questions for Michael Connelly, or turn the tables to see what Connelly asked Evanovich. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evanovich&lt;/strong&gt;: So dude,... Okay, you're back in Florida. Do you ever get to the beach? And when and if you get to the beach...is Harry Bosch with you? And what kind of beachwear are you guys sporting? Flip-flops? Crocs? Speedo? Board shorts?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connelly&lt;/strong&gt;: I go to the beach often on weekends. Board shorts are required and I wear flip-flops with the built in bottle opener. Comes in handy. In Florida we rarely have waves, unless there is a hurricane in the Gulf. So I have taken up paddle-boarding, which essentially involves a big surfboard that you stand on and paddle. Still a balancing act, but easier than surfing, and you don't need waves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evanovich&lt;/strong&gt;: What will a bookstore look like in 2020? Will we all be downloading?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connelly&lt;/strong&gt;: Good question. Since it is only eleven years from now, I think there will still be a solid population of "old school" readers who need the book in their hands. The question is, will they get it at a bookstore or will we have a Kindle 9.0 device that manufactures a book for you at home, complete with photo of author in a bomber jacket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evanovich&lt;/strong&gt;: If everybody is downloading in 2020 what the heck will we be signing on book tour? Body parts? Kindle cases?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connelly&lt;/strong&gt;: I signed two Kindles yesterday. One person asked me to leave room for signatures from you and Dennis Lehane. So next time you're in Seattle she'll be in your line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evanovich&lt;/strong&gt;: Do you eat when you write? Beer nuts? M&amp;amp;Ms? Just coffee? What keeps you from falling out of the chair in a narcoleptic stupor?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connelly&lt;/strong&gt;: Have you ever seen what eating Cheetos can do to a keyboard? I have to say I am addicted to Coke. I always have a glass of it nearby. I eat a lot of candy, too. Keeps me going. Smarties are a great writing tool. I often need to raid my daughter's stash and then there is trouble on the home front.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evanovich&lt;/strong&gt;: Are you a messy guy or a neat guy? Do you keep clutter on your desk? In your head? Are there soda cans and crumpled fast food wrappers rolling around on the floor of your car?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connelly&lt;/strong&gt;: I keep a clean car but a desk that gets progressively messier as I write a book. When I am finished with the book, I clean up the desk—and eat all the stray Smarties found under the paperwork. The clean desk then promotes the start of the next book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evanovich&lt;/strong&gt;: The new book, &lt;em&gt;The Scarecrow&lt;/em&gt; sounds terrific, and I know it's followed by Harry Bosch in &lt;em&gt;Nine Dragons&lt;/em&gt; in the fall. Does your publisher prefer one series over another? And do you find one series to be more commercially viable than another?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connelly&lt;/strong&gt;: They let me do what I want. I like writing about Harry Bosch and he's pretty popular, but usually when I write a standalone it widens the audience a bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evanovich&lt;/strong&gt;: Want to meet me in a bar in Ft. Myers? Is that halfway?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connelly&lt;/strong&gt;: Name the place. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;From Publishers Weekly&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starred Review. Bestseller Connelly comments on the plight of print journalism in a nail-biting thriller featuring reporter Jack McEvoy, last seen in 2004's &lt;em&gt;The Narrows&lt;/em&gt;. When Jack is laid off from the &lt;em&gt;L.A. Times&lt;/em&gt; with 14 days' notice to tie up loose ends, he decides to go out with a bang. What starts as a story about the wrongful arrest of a young gangbanger for the brutal rape and murder of an exotic dancer turns out to be just the tip of an iceberg that takes McEvoy from the Nevada desert to a futuristic data-hosting facility in Arizona. FBI agent Rachel Walling, with whom he worked on a serial killer case in 1996's &lt;em&gt;The Poet&lt;/em&gt;, soon joins the hunt, but as the pair uncover more about the killer and his unsettling predilections, they realize that they too are being hunted. With every switch between McEvoy's voice and the villain's, Connelly ratchets up the tension. This magnificent effort is a reminder of why Connelly is one of today's top crime authors. &lt;em&gt;8-city author tour.
