Stephen Montgomery was one of the hated English.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He came to Scotland as a conqueror, saw her beauty and was vanquished. But still she would abhor him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She owned a temper hot enough to forge the armors of battle or inflame a valiant soldier's passion. Yet still she would resist him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She became his reason to live, his reason to love. And still she would deny him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while clan fought clan, while brother took up sword against brother, and the highlands ran with blood -- their destiny was made...and this mighty warrior pledged himself to his woman's pride, her honor and her name -- and made of their love a torch to burn through the ages! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;About the Author&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jude Deveraux is the author ofÂ forty &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestsellers, including &lt;em&gt;The Scent of Jasmine, Scarlet Nights, Days of Gold, Lavender Morning, Return to Summerhouse, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Secrets. &lt;/em&gt;To date, there are more than sixty million copies of her books in print worldwide.
