But despite her flourishing jewelry-making career, Kim’s own happiness seems as distant as the childhood summer when she played the hours away with young Travis Merritt, who came to Edilean with his mother under mysterious circumstances. At the end of that innocent season, he promised Kim he would return one day . . . and then vanished without even a goodbye. Years later, a worn photo is Kim’s only proof of the perfect joy they shared. But when she least expects it, Travis, now a savvy Manhattan attorney, will crash into her life once more. Will Kim see the boy she knew under the man he’s become?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;About the Author&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jude Deveraux &lt;/strong&gt;is the author of more than forty &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestsellers, including &lt;em&gt;Moonlight in the Morning&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Scent of Jasmine, Scarlet Nights, Days of Gold, Lavender Morning, Return to Summerhouse, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Secrets. &lt;/em&gt;To date, there are more than sixty million copies of her books in print worldwide.
