Enjoy this Q&amp;amp;A--as well as a personal note to Amazon readers--from John Grisham. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Your new novel starts off where most courtroom dramas end--with the verdict. Where did you get the idea to reverse the usual order of events this time around?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The actual trial is not a terribly significant part of the story. Most all of the action and intrigue begins after the trial is over, with the verdict and the subsequent appeal.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. &lt;em&gt;The Appeal&lt;/em&gt; overtly suggests that elected judges can be bought. If the novel is meant as a cautionary tale, what's next--the Presidential primaries?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why not? Over one billion dollars will be spent next year in the Presidential primaries and general election. With that kind of money floating around, anything can be bought.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Speaking of electoral politics, you've been more vocal recently about your political views ... first supporting Jim Webb for Senate and now endorsing Hillary Clinton for the White House. Have you given any thought to running for office yourself?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;No. I made that mistake 25 years ago, and promised myself I would never do it again. I enjoy watching and participating in politics from the sidelines, but it's best to keep some distance.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. This is your first legal thriller in three years. How did it feel to get back to the genre that started it all, and can fans expect another thriller from you next year?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;I still enjoy writing the legal thrillers, and don't plan to get too far away from them. Obviously, they have been very good to me, and they remain popular. I plan to write one a year for the next several years.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Your nonfiction book &lt;em&gt;The Innocent Man&lt;/em&gt; continues to be a bestseller in paperback. In your ongoing work with The Innocence Project, have you come across another story of the wrongfully convicted that begs to be written as nonfiction?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are literally hundreds of great stories out there about wrongfully convicted defendants. I am continually astounded by these stories, and I resist the temptation to take the plunge again into non-fiction.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. What's on your bedside reading list at the moment?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. &lt;em&gt;The Nine&lt;/em&gt; by Jeffrey Toobin&lt;br&gt;2.  Eric Clapton's autobiography&lt;br&gt;3.  &lt;em&gt;East of Eden&lt;/em&gt; by John Steinbeck.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;From Publishers Weekly&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Mississippi jury returns a $41-million verdict against a chemical company accused of dumping carcinogenic waste into a small town's water supply. The company's ruthless billionaire CEO is thwarted and the good guys (a courageous young woman who lost her husband and child and her two lawyers who've gone half a million dollars in debt preparing her case) receives its just reward. This sounds like the end of a Grisham legal thriller, but instead it's the beginning of a book-length lesson in how greed and big business have corrupted our electoral and judicial systems. Grisham's characters are over-the-top. The CEO and the other equally overdone villains—his venal trophy wife, a self-serving senator and a pair of smarmy political fixers—as well as the unbelievably good-hearted, self-sacrificing lawyers and an honorable state judge, are one dimensional. Michael Beck, with his natural Southern drawl, does a fine job of adding credibility and nuance to the large cast. But his efforts are for naught. In fact, the more he makes us feel for these characters, the less apt we are to be satisfied with the sourball moral of Grisham's downbeat discourse. &lt;br&gt;Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.
