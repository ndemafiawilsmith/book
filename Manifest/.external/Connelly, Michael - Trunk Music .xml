Detective Hieronymous Bosch investigates – his first case since returning to homicide Division. Tony Aliso (deceased) was a minor film producer churning out straight-to-video soft porn and making more money than he should out of it. Harry suspects that one of the Mob realised how much Tony was skimming off the top in the laundering service he provided. The investigation takes Hieronymous (AKA Harry) to Las Vegas and face-to-face with an ex-lover.  </dc:description></dp:metadata><dp:privateData xmlns:dp="http://ns.adobe.com/digitalpublishing"><totalPageCount xmlns="http://ns.adobe.com/digitaleditions">281</totalPageCount></dp:privateData><dp:tags xmlns:dp="http://ns.adobe.com/digitalpublishing"><dp:tag>private:ub42</dp:tag></dp:tags></contentRecord>
