When Graciella Rivers steps onto his boat, ex-FBI agent Terrell McCaleb has no idea he's about to come out of retirement. He's recuperating from a heart transplant and avoiding anything stressful. But when Graciella tells him the way her sister Gloria was murdered it leaves Terry no choice. Now the man with the new heart vows to take down a predator without a soul. For Gloria's killer shatters every rule that McCaleb ever learned in his years with the Bureau--as McCaleb gets no more second chances at life... and just one shot at the truth. Blood Work is now a major motion picture from Warner Bros. directed by and starring Clint Eastwood. The movie also stars Anjelica Huston and Jeff Daniels. Blood Work hit bestseller lists nationwide, including those of the New York Times, USA Today, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, Los Angeles Times, and Dallas Morning News. It has over 900,000 paperback copies in print.</dc:description></dp:metadata><dp:privateData xmlns:dp="http://ns.adobe.com/digitalpublishing"><totalPageCount xmlns="http://ns.adobe.com/digitaleditions">341</totalPageCount></dp:privateData><dp:tags xmlns:dp="http://ns.adobe.com/digitalpublishing"><dp:tag>private:ub42</dp:tag></dp:tags></contentRecord>
