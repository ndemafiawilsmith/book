Actually, the small-town librarian had just been stood up by her fianc√© when she ran into the errant angel with her car. And while he appears to be unscathed, "Michael" continues to insist that his pedigree is quite legitimate. Emily just hopes his brain hasn't been scrambled in the accident; besides, she's not inclined to believe that an angel could be so dangerously sexy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet Michael quickly reveals the most astounding things about her, and makes her laugh in a way she never has before. What's more, he declares that he's been sent to save her. At this point, the only rescue Emily has in mind is her upcoming marriage, and she's ready to bid her most attractive angel good-bye. But when he lets slip that he also looks at souls -- and hers is a rare beauty -- Emily's ready to risk heaven in his arms. Their journey will break every angelic and earthly rule before it yields her one wish: a love divine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;About the Author&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jude Deveraux is the author of twenty-two &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestsellers, including &lt;em&gt;Legend, The Heiress, Rememberance, Sweet Liar, A Knight in Shining Armor,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Duchess.&lt;/em&gt; She began writing in 1976, and to date there are more than thirty million copies of her books in print.
