Suddenly they are fleeing the long arm of a clandestine and increasingly powerful renegade government agency -- the woman hunted for the information she possesses, the man mistaken as her comrade in a burgeoning resistance movement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The architect of the chase is a man of uncommon madness and cruelty -- ruthless, possibly psychotic, and equipped with a vast technological arsenal. He is the brazen face of an insidiously fascistic future. And he is virtually unstoppable. But he has never before come up against the likes of his current quarry. Both of them are survivors of singularly horrific pasts. Both have long been emboldened by their experiences to fight with reckless courage for their own freedom. Now they are plunged into a struggle for the freedom of their country, and for the sanctity of their own lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dark Rivers of the Heart is an electrifying thriller that steers us along the razor edge of a familiar, terrifying reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;From Publishers Weekly&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Koontz's tale of a man, a woman and a dog on the run from a high-tech rogue government agency was a PW bestseller for nine weeks. &lt;br&gt;Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;From Library Journal&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spencer Grant is on the run from a nameless, violent government agency. His goal is to keep away from his pursuers long enough to find the woman he met the night before, who appears to be their real target. Spencer has no idea why they want to kill Valerie Keene, but his brief acquaintance with her has convinced him that the killers have no good reason for wanting her dead. With his game but fearful dog, Rocky, Spencer leads the killers on a frustrating chase. By the end of the story, Spencer must confront his own personal demons as well as the bizarre sociopathic agent leading the hunt. The government's activities-especially the incredible surveillance techniques that Koontz, in an afterword, claims are currently being used-help create an atmosphere of intense paranoia and fear. This superb suspense novel will surely delight the author's many fans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;--A.M.B.
