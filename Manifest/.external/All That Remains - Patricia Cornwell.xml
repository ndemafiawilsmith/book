So far, four couples in the area have disappeared, only to be found months later as mutilated corpses. When the daughter of the president's newest drug czar vanishes along with her boyfriend, Dr. Kay Scarpetta knows time is short. Following a macabre trail of evidence that ties the present homicides to a grisly crime in the past, Kay must draw upon her own personal resources to track down a murderer who is as skilled at eliminating clues as Kay is at finding them....&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h3&gt;From Publishers Weekly&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edgar, Anthony, Creasey and McCavity Award winner Cornwell ( Body of Evidence ) combines bone-rattling suspense with an insider's view of forensic science as her sleuth, Richmond, Va., medical examiner Kay Scarpetta, investigates a series of grim murders of young couples. With bone fragments being, in effect, all that remains of badly decomposed corpses, Scarpetta, Richmond homicide detective Pete Marino, ace reporter Abby Turnbull and even psychic Hilda Ozimek must employ their combined expertise--and a good deal of raw courage--to trace the killer. The case is complicated by the identity of one victim, daughter of Pat Harvey, the high-profile female national drug policy director and vice-presidential hopeful, and by the reentry into Scarpetta's life of a lover who is lying about his line of work. In her best novel to date, Cornwell demonstrates that clues about character are as vital as physical evidence at the crime scene. Mystery Guild selection; Literary Guild featured alternate; Time-Life Condensed Book selection; major ad/promo; author tour; paperback rights to Avon. &lt;br&gt;Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;From School Library Journal&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;YA-- The decomposed bodies of Fred Cheyney and Deborah Harvey don't show up for months, well into Dr. Kay Scarpetta's account of her investigation into their disappearance. The two lovers are the fifth pair in a string of mysterious ``couple murders,'' all bearing the same characteristics: two young people completely vanish, leaving behind an abandoned car and no clues about their fate. Months later the skeletal remains are found by hunters in remote wooded locales, and no evidence about the causes of death can be discovered. At the same time, the FBI appears to be foiling attempts to discover the identity of the murderer by withholding crime-scene information, and Kay's old friend Abby, a newspaper reporter, complicates matters by conducting her own search for the truth. This rich brew makes for a compelling story to which Cornwell has added such stand-bys from her two previous Scarpetta novels as Pete Marino, a middle-aged police detective, and Benton Wesley, an FBI investigator who knows how to keep a secret. Mystery-loving YAs and fans of Cornwell's previous novels will enjoy her latest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;- Carolyn E.
