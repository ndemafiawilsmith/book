  Starred Review. Connelly's compelling fourth legal thriller featuring 
Mickey Haller (after Reversal) finds the maverick L.A. lawyer who uses 
his Lincoln town car as an office specializing in "foreclosure defense."
 Haller's first foreclosure client, Lisa Trammel, is fighting hard to 
keep her home, maybe too hard. The bank has gotten a restraining order 
to stop Trammel's protests, and she becomes the prime suspect when 
Mitchell Bondurant, a mortgage banker, is killed with a hammer in his 
office parking lot. A ton of evidence points to Trammel, but Haller 
crafts an impressive defense that includes "the fifth witness" of the 
title. Connelly has a sure command of the legal and procedural details 
of criminal court, and even manages to make the arcane, shady world of 
foreclosure interesting. While the prose may lack some of the poetic 
nuance of his early novels, the plot is worthy of a master storyteller. 
The film of The Lincoln Lawyer, the first Mickey Haller novel, releases 
in March. (Apr.) &lt;br&gt;(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.  All rights reserved.

  &lt;p&gt;*Starred Review* Crime-fiction megastar Connelly can always be 
counted on to try something a little different. In The Reversal (2010), 
his last Mickey Haller novel, starring the L.A. lawyer who prefers to 
work out of his Lincoln Town Car, Connelly offered a tour de force of 
plotting on multiple levels. Here, he narrows the focus considerably, 
concentrating almost exclusively on what happens inside the courtroom 
but bringing to the traditional give-and-take of prosecutor, defender, 
judge, and jury an altogether more complex commingling of personality 
and legal strategy than is typically on view in legal thrillers. He 
accomplishes this with a particularly rich first-person narration in 
which Haller takes us through the courtroom drama as it happens, noting 
his blunders and praising himself for quick-thinking improvisations. It 
doesn't hurt, either, that the plot is meaty: a woman whom Haller was 
representing in a suit against the bank attempting to foreclose on her 
mortgage is accused of killing the bank official in charge of 
foreclosures. Combining ripped-from-the-headlines information on the 
mortgage crisis with a cast of characters that defies stereotypes at 
every turn of the plot, Connelly shows once again that he will never 
simply ride the wave of past success. And, neither, apparently, will 
Mickey Haller, as he reveals a shocking change of direction in the 
novel's final pages. &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;HIGH-DEMAND BACKSTORY: Connelly's latest
 Mickey Haller novel will benefit from the release in March of a movie 
version of The Lincoln Lawyer, the first Haller novel, starring Matthew 
McConaughey. 750,000 first printing. --Bill Ott&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</dc:description></dp:metadata><dp:privateData xmlns:dp="http://ns.adobe.com/digitalpublishing"><totalPageCount xmlns="http://ns.adobe.com/digitaleditions">407</totalPageCount></dp:privateData><dp:tags xmlns:dp="http://ns.adobe.com/digitalpublishing"><dp:tag>private:ub42</dp:tag></dp:tags></contentRecord>
