How to hide within its shadows. When to hunt. &lt;br&gt; He roamed from town to town, city to city, choosing his prey for their beauty and innocence. His cruelties were infinite, his humanity long since forfeit. But still . . . he had not yet discovered how to make his special mark among monsters, how to come fully alive as Death. &lt;br&gt; This is the story of how he learned those things, and of what we might do to ensure that he does not visit us. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Review&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Praise for Dean Koontz:‘A terrific pursuit story … clever, up-to-the-minute, and riveting’ Guardian‘There’s surprise after surprise, including a killer finale … a read-in-one-go novel’ Independent on Sunday‘Hits its pace from the first page and races through to a suitably climactic ending’ Sydney Sunday Telegraph‘Dean Koontz is not just a master of our darkest dreams, but also a literary juggler’ The Times‘Psychologically complex, masterly and satisfying’ The New York Times &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;About the Author&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The books of Dean Koontz are published in 38 languages, and worldwide sales top 400 million copies.
