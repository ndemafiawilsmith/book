But caring encompasses more than simply looking after peopleâ€™s physical health needs. People requiring any health service will have psychological needs that affect their feelings, thoughts, and behaviour. Good psychological care can even help improve physical health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Introduction to Psychological Care in Nursing and the Health Professions&lt;/em&gt; explains and promotes the importance of psychological care for people when they become physically ill, giving a sound theoretical basis to ensure care is evidence-based. It encourages the reader to think about the effects of illness and disability on patients, and to understand what can be done to identify and minimise any difficulties they might be experiencing in these areas. The chapters cover:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the meaning and elements of care and holistic care; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a model of psychological care in practice; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the personal qualities and skills of carers that best underpin psychological care delivery, and how these might be enhanced; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the knowledge needed for effective psychological caregiving; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;psychological care as it might be practised in a range of health care settings. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This text contains key learning points, practical activities, reflective exercises and case illustrations. It is ideal for student and practising nurses, and health professionals who would like to improve their care for patients in this essential area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;About the Author&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Helena Priest&lt;/strong&gt; is Senior Lecturer in the School of Psychology at Keele University, UK.
