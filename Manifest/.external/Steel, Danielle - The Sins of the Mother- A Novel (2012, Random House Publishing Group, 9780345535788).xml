choices. And no one has made more difficult choices than Olivia Grayson.
 The enormously successful businesswoman missed out on much of her 
children’s lives while she built her legendary home-furnishings empire. 
In Danielle Steel’s character-rich new novel, Olivia faces the past, 
tries to balance the present, and makes amends where due, while still 
running her vastly successful business.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE SINS OF THE MOTHER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 As a way of making up to them for time lost, Olivia spends months every
 year planning a lavish holiday that everyone in her family will enjoy. 
This summer she has arranged a dream trip in the Mediterranean on a 
luxurious yacht, which she hopes will be the most memorable vacation of 
all. Her lavish gesture every year expresses her love for them, and 
regret at all the important times she missed during her children’s 
younger years. Her younger daughter, Cassie, a hip London music 
producer, refuses the invitation altogether, as she does every year. Her
 older daughter, Liz, lives in her mother’s shadow, with a terror of 
failure as she tries to recapture her dream of being a writer. And her 
sons, John and Phillip, work for Olivia, for better or worse, with wives
 who wish they didn’t. In the splendor of the Riviera, this should be a 
summer to remember, with Olivia’s children, grandchildren, and 
daughters-in-law on board. But as with any family gathering, there are 
always surprises, and no matter how glamorous the setting things don’t 
always turn out as ones hopes. &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; Family dynamics are 
complicated, old disappointments die hard, and as forgiveness and 
surprising revelations enter into it, new bonds are formed, and the 
future takes on a brighter hue. And one by one, with life’s irony, 
Olivia’s children find themselves committing the same “sins” for which 
they blamed their mother for so many years. It is a summer of 
compassion, important lessons, and truth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description></dp:metadata><dp:privateData xmlns:dp="http://ns.adobe.com/digitalpublishing"><totalPageCount xmlns="http://ns.adobe.com/digitaleditions">266</totalPageCount></dp:privateData><dp:tags xmlns:dp="http://ns.adobe.com/digitalpublishing"><dp:tag>private:ub42</dp:tag></dp:tags></contentRecord>
