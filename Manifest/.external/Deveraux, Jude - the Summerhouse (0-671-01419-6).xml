 their licenses renewed at the New York City Department of Motor 
Vehicles. Sharing the same birthday, they became instant friends. Now 
they're all turning 40, and although they haven't seen each other since 
that long-ago day, when Ellie invites the others for a reunion in Maine,
 they agree to attend. Once there, they realize that their lives haven't
 turned out as planned. But then the trio stumble across Madame Zoya of 
Futures, Inc., who make them an irresistible offer: they can relive any 
three weeks from the past, armed with the knowledge since gained. 
Afterwards, they must decide: should they stick with the lives they have
 or go with the new futures they've created?Â &lt;/p&gt;</dc:description></dp:metadata><dp:privateData xmlns:dp="http://ns.adobe.com/digitalpublishing"><totalPageCount xmlns="http://ns.adobe.com/digitaleditions">271</totalPageCount></dp:privateData><dp:tags xmlns:dp="http://ns.adobe.com/digitalpublishing"><dp:tag>private:ub42</dp:tag></dp:tags></contentRecord>
