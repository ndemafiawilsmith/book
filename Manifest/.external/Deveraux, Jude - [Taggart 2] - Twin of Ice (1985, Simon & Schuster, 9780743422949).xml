Her twin sister, Blair, is independent, hot-tempered, and madly in love -- with Houston's fiancé. Their entwined adventures across the American frontier are captured in two novels as powerfully compelling as ice and fire?. Happily betrothed to Dr. Lee Westfield, Houston is every bit the good girl she was raised to be. So when faced with Kane Taggert's brash marriage proposal, Houston is outwardly shocked. But beneath her gracious demeanor lies a woman of hidden longings -- and her defenses begin to melt the second this rugged stranger touches his hungry lips to hers. While dreaming of practicing medicine, Blair falls in love with her placid sister's fiancé, himself a passionate doctor. Blair's impetuous spirit has won her a medical degree in a man's world -- and captivated Lee's heart. But even as the couple's ardor grows, there are nights when Lee disappears only to return exhausted, haunted. His silence imperils their love. But the truth would imperil her life.&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description></dp:metadata><dp:privateData xmlns:dp="http://ns.adobe.com/digitalpublishing"><totalPageCount xmlns="http://ns.adobe.com/digitaleditions">278</totalPageCount></dp:privateData><dp:tags xmlns:dp="http://ns.adobe.com/digitalpublishing"><dp:tag>private:ub42</dp:tag></dp:tags></contentRecord>
