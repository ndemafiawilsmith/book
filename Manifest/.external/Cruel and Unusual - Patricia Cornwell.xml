But they can't explain how Dr. Kay Scarpetta finds Waddell's fingerprints on &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; crime scene -- &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; she'd performed his autopsy. If this is some sort of game, Scarpetta seems to be the target. And if the next victim is someone she knows, the punishment will be cruel and unusual...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;From Publishers Weekly&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This fourth mystery to feature Virginia Chief Medical Officer Dr. Kay Scarpetta was a 12-week PW bestseller. &lt;br&gt;Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;From School Library Journal&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;YA-In this fourth Kay Scarpetta mystery, the chief medical examiner for the state of Virginia is once again challenged by gruesome murder and confusing evidence. How could the fingerprints of Ronnie Joe Waddell appear at the scene of a murdered psychic after Waddell was executed in the electric chair? In the midst of many puzzling matters come other difficult issues to confront Kay as she tries to do her job. She becomes the object of hysterical media attention, and finds that she herself might be indicted for the very crimes she is trying to solve. Someone is sabotaging her efforts by hacking into her computer files and leaking information. Exasperated, she calls upon her niece, Lucy, a 17-year-old computer whiz, whom readers will remember from earlier "Scarpetta" novels. Along with FBI agent Benton Wesley and police chum Pete Marino, Lucy helps Kay solve the murders and ferret out the traitor in her office. YAs will enjoy the teen's angst and the exciting twist at the book's end.&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carolyn E.
